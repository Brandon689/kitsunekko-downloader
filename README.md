# kitsunekko-downloader

Download all the Japanese subtitles off Kitsunekko for archival. It is VERY slow, but it is left this way so it doesn't consume too many server resources. And if you close the process, it can resume where it left off. Can also be run on the Chinese and English subtitles on Kitsunekko.

Some of the invalid folder names on there can cause subs to be skipped, you can check which if any subs were missed.
